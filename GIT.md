## creating issue branches
*Issues should be created for every branch that is made. 
The format to the issue should be in all lowercase letters and use snake case when possible.* 


Branches will be automatically closed once a **Pull Request (PR)** is merged into the **dev** branch. 

### Format

```
issue/<dev name>/<issue number>_description
```

### Example

```
issue/matthew/0_create_readme
```
